                                <p>As I mentioned above, my two specialties are <strong>launching new products and automating business/operations processes</strong> in order to make your company more scalable and efficient.</p>

                                <p>The way I've developed those two specialties is by making a process on how to do them successfully and improving them over time. That has enabled me to improve every time and figure out how to improve,
								which has led me to success from <strong>building an MVP that got 500 users and a launch on product hunt in the first week on getting the idea</strong> or <strong>reducing the time it took to print books from 12 days to 4 days.</strong>

                                <p>Beyond my work, I love to hike, see movies, try as many new things as possible from trying the newest restaurant to skydiving. And I am a huge believer
								and practicer of personal development, always moving forward.</p>

                            <p>Interestingly enough, automation is very similar to creating new products. Talking to the people who do the job, understanding the business case and process, and building the replacement technology. The really cool thing here is taking a huge burden off someone's plate or helping a business scale. Check out my <a style='color:black;'>Automation Playbook</a> to see how I do it consistently.

                                    <p>As part of our interaction with realtors, we started getting some people asking for work done with homes that aren't even built yet. And if you check out Walkthrough VR, you can follow along with the initial success we had. Essentially, realtors need the ability to show off a house that doesn't exist yet, and blueprints don't cut it. So, we made a way to tour them combining three different expertises of programming, 3d Modeling, and game development.</p>

                                    <p>Unfortunately, after bringing a successful product to market, it had a huge problem with scale. A single house could take 160 hours to make. After a month long project it takes a couple hours of unskilled labor and about 40 hours of distributed computing time. But now, its possible to create a photorealistic version of a house that doesn't exist quickly and easily. Check out the link to see it.</p>

                                    <p>Walkthrough is part Virtual Reality Company and part Photography Company. And the backbone of that photography company is based around the idea of producing professional levels of photography using a science instead of an art. Find out more about how we developed that science by looking at Walkthrough Photography. With that, we had photo processing. </p>

                                    <p>At the beginning of the company, photo processing took 2 hours per house. Now that Walkthrough has scaled to 200 homes a month, that would've taken 400 hours. But because most of it is automated, it takes about 5 minutes per house for QA. Making the business significantly more scalable.</p>

                                    <p>Creating A Virtual Reality Product isn't an easy undertaking because of how new the technology is. However, we worked to make something just like the tour of a house. And we did that in two ways.</p>

                                    <p>First, you can see from the video above an example of what we built for people looking at real homes. Secondly, we were able to apply this to homes in development as well. One of the homes we built was under construction in Vail, and we were able to show potential buyers within the property itself while under construction. And it was good enough <a href='http://www.vaildaily.com/news/prospective-buyers-get-virtual-reality-tour-of-remodeled-red-lion-penthouse/'>to make the news.</a> </p>

                                    <p>In order to make a successful virtual reality company for real estate, we needed inventory. In order to get it, we created a photography company, but unfortunately, we didn't know how to be professional photographers. So, we started interviewing realtors and photographers.</p>

                                    <p>Customer Interviews and research brought up everything from the type of photography they like, from what shots to take to brightness levels of indoors and outdoors, from their favorite communications from photographers. And with that, we took everything we learned and created a process that we can teach anyone in about an hour to take professional photography of real estate, and give realtors all the pieces they need from an online scheduler, to the right email communication, to excellent photography. And realtors love it!</p>

                                    <p>After working in web analytics for almost a year, I had the idea of creating a product that could both help me as well as anyone who couldn't afford a web analyst. Luckily, while working with clients, I knew exactly what they needed. Reports don't help, insights and guidance do. People don't want data, they want someone to show them the opportunities and give them clear direction to improve.</p>

                                    <p>With all that in mind, I built a landing page to illustrate the idea of a SaaS service automatically analyzing your data, giving you an idea of what to do next and keeping track of your progress. It was a huge hit. I posted it to reddit and hackernews. I got over 500 sign-ups. Soon enough, I was contacted by someone telling me I was on product hunt. And users were having a great experience.</p>

And one of the problems is knowing people's actual performance as people aren't recording their data other than a score on the golf course. Secondly, its bright outside and so electronic devices are hard to use. So, we took a two prongued approach to this.</p>

                                    <p>First, we used a printable version of the golf course to record your data on, which included what club you used and where you hit it. Then, you could put it online later using a google maps version of the system to indicate exactly where you hit it and what club you used. That solved the problem to be able to collect the data in a way that couldn't easily be done before.</p>

									<p>Secondly, I was brought on to do an analysis of every trading account in the firm to look for and identify suspicious activity. After building the system, we were able to quickly clean up accounts with slight mistakes in their PnL and identify a host of accounts for the management team to look into.</p>

                                    <p>Jeremy also demonstrated skills to present problems and opportunities to upper management. By the end of his term Jeremy was considered more of an internal consultant and valued team member than just an interim resource.
In closing, let me say I have no hesitation in recommending Jeremy. I feel confident he would be an asset to any organization. </p>

                                    <p>Love using Walkthrough for listing photos. They always look great when we get them back. The 3D tour is especially handy for conveying the layout of a space and being able to navigate it. We have these 3D walkthroughs on all our listings. Highly recommended.</p>
